# Terminology and Definitions

## Span

A `Span` is a model with a range of some value (dates, numbers, etc).

## Segment

A `Segment` is a model with a range of some value (dates, numbers, etc) that is a subset of a `Span`. A `Span` can have multiple `Segment` instances, but a `Segment` can only belong to one `Span`.
